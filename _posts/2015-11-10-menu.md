title: The Menu Is Alive!
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

More than a couple months after initially setting up this site, I finally took the time to set up the drinks menu. <!--more--> (For some reason, my brain keeps farting through my fingers and an "e" magically appears at the end of menu every time I type it today. I've had a couple run-ins with this in the codes, too.)

So the "Mainstays," as the name suggests, will stay and be workable year round. The *real* delight is the Seasonal section. It updates per the season. 

Technical bit ahead: Now I really enjoyed using [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com) as a static site generator, because I can set up all the information for my menu in a YAML file and use Liquid formulas to just generate the line for each menu item. I can even plan the seasonal drinks and just comment them out for each season.

I'm sure there's a way to set it up to automatically transition between seasons based on the date. I'll have to look into that in the future. For the time being, I'll just have to change it over come winter.
