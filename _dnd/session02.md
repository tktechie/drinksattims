From Taracob's Journal:

>After emerging from the woods into a large plain we were greeted by a wizard named Torm and a Ranger of noble blood named Lady Moonshine of Doubtfire.  Torm was apparently an old acquaintance of Verthenion.  On the way into town to pick up supplies we spotted a person on a ridge that seemed to be keeping tabs on us, after a while he had vanished, but not soon after that we were ambushed by a group of bandits apparently after our treasure.  After an intense battle we asked Torm of the origins of the bandits and how the manage to find us, Torm revealed that he had been followed to the rendezvous point, but he neglected to tell the rest of us that bit of information; Some people give Wizards a bad name.

**DM Note:** Saturday, September 6th, our session starts at 6.
