Hi all! I'm glad you're actually taking the time to read this. I'm going to try keeping it somewhat brief and to the point. I'm honestly not sure how much or little you were expecting here, so if you have any questions, text me. Or get ahold of me through other means. I'm tktechie pretty much everywhere except facebook (I don't like FB).

I've decided the world our campaign will take place in has all the major history & lore that's laid out in the player's handbooks. This will make it easier on me as a first time DM to take the time designing adventures instead of history. That said, many (if not all) of the cities, towns, and other locations we adventure through will be entirely made up, with bits and pieces from this reference and that.

> We left off last session at the northern tip of a sea-faring city, Dewarhaven, and the initial meeting point of the three player characters: Namir (Zach), Teldorath (Michaela), and Taracob (Chris). Namir & Teldorath, acknowledging each others presence, await the docking of the vessel carrying a shipment for which they've been contracted to help deliver across the land. {the reason why, you'll have to RP to find out. I've decided Chris's character only even has a vague idea of what's in the chest}

For the purposes of potentially thinking about your character's background story, at least enough for the short term, assume the following: 

- Namir & Teldorath know each other, *at least* in passing.
- Taracob, you're a newcomer to the continent.
- You'll all be meeting a representative from your employer. Though Taracob has already sailed with said NPC, he was unaware of the traveler's reason for also being on the ship.
- don't worry, I'm not going to force you all into that tavern.. Unless you play the story that way.

In closing, I've done a ton of reading to prep for this weekend. And I expect to do a ton more!
